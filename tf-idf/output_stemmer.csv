44sample_data,Did Sandra Bullock Already Know About Jesse James' Affair at Oscars?,"LOS ANGELES - The news of Jessie James' affair only hit the headlines last week (thanks to mistress Michelle ""Bombshell"" McGee selling her story), and Sandra Bullock may have been ""visually impaired"" by her husband before receiving an Oscar for Best Actress.  Bullock just confessed, let's touch it, and after calling her name a winner, he whispered ""something private"" in her ear and gave him a dim look before she jumped out of her seat.  Although she appeared quite ready on stage, she failed to thank him in her acceptance speech (though she did not forget her ""lover"" Meryl Streep) and changed the subject when asked about him behind the scenes. ""I will never reveal it unless you first reveal what Jesse says."" : Photos: Who is Michelle 'Bombshell' McGee? This is significant, as Bullock claims to be ""her man"" at the SAG Awards just a few weeks ago. ",0.07518796840748491,0.012578615173450528,0.0330292172646903
37sample_data,"The nation’s largest bank has grown tremendously in recent years with major acquisitions, while also suffering through a perilous economy and steep losses from the mortgage crisis.","Bank of America Corp, the country's largest bank, has unveiled plans to cut 30,000 jobs worldwide over the next few years, as part of an aggressive effort to streamline its long-haul operations and deal with billions of dollars in toxic mortgages and a continuing weak economy.  Analysts say the cuts will probably affect the company's operations in Massachusetts, but bank officials say it is too early to say how many cuts will occur here.  Bank officials said it was too early to say how many additional jobs could be cut in the second term, but suggested it might be smaller than the jobs revealed yesterday. “The challenging environment is affecting all banks and not just the Bank of America,” Morford said.  But banking analyst Richard Bove said Moynihan had to cut deeper than other banks because the company was large through acquisitions and the amount of mortgage-related losses it suffered from Countrywide in 2008 called Bove one of the worst acquisitions on record. ""The bank makes a number of acquisitions, then decides that it has over-extended itself and needs to shrink and focus on its core business."" The bank said that many job cuts would occur by not filling vacant or vacant jobs instead of full layoffs. ",0.17177913834017092,0.0,0.09858433797888543

And this one did its home city and country proud. . Too bad only a few hundred concertgoers were there to enjoy it.","The St. Petersburg State Academic Symphony Orchestra performs at the Symphony Hall on Wednesday under principal guest conductor Vladimir Lande, not the August St. Petersburg (formerly Leningrad) Philharmonic Orchestra, which traces the history of 1882.  The All-Slavic program began with a novelty, Polish composer Mikzislaw Weinberg's 1949 ""Rhapsody on Moldavian Themes,"" and the more familiar fare, Prokofiev's Piano Concerto No. 3, Chinese soloist Xian Wang and Tchaikovsky's Symphony no. She didn't help the orchestra, it was too loud (a shrill piccolo, for one) and lacked finesse and wit - what happened to the sly gawot that opened the slow motion? Lande's Tchaikovsky is portrayed in similar shots: bold, poignant and sometimes bombastic.  But the enthusiasm of the Andante Cantabile is reminiscent of Serge Koussevitzky's legendary 1944 BSO recording, featuring fragile, russet-colored early horn areas and luscious solos from Obo and Bassoon.
